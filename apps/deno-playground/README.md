Deploying edgetunnel on Deno Playground
=======================================

[Deno Playground](https://deno.com/deploy) is a cloud-based service that allows you to easily deploy and host your Deno vless nodes. It's free to use and doesn't require any configuration. In this tutorial, we'll show you how to deploy a Deno vless node on Deno Playground.

Prerequisites
-------------

Before we start, you'll need to have the following:

*   A Deno code that you want to deploy (e.g. index.ts).
*   A Deno Playground account (you can create one [here](https://dashboard.deno.com/deploy)).
*   A UUID generator (e.g. [uuidgenerator.net](https://www.uuidgenerator.net/)).
*   A password generator (e.g. [passwordsgenerator.net](https://passwordsgenerator.net/)).

Steps
-----

1.  Open the [Deno Playground dashboard](https://dashboard.deno.com/deploy) and log in to your account.
    
2.  Click on the "Play" button.
    
3.  Copy your Deno vless node code from index.ts file to the Deno editor.
    
4.  Replace the following variables in the code with your own values:
    
    *   `uuid` - replace with your own UUID (e.g. 123e4567-e89b-12d3-a456-426655440000 or generated by [uuidgenerator.net](https://www.uuidgenerator.net/)).
    *   `password` - replace with your own password in the code (must be at least 8 characters long).
    *   `username` - replace with your own username in the code (must be at least 8 characters long).
5.  Once your vless node code has been copied, click on the "Save & Deploy" button.
    
6.  Your vless node is now deployed, and you can access it using the URL provided by Deno Playground.
    
7.  Useful URL paths:
    
    *   /\* - your vless node or login to see vless link.
    *   /info - all info about the deployed Deno node.
    *   /{your setting uuid} - see vless link for each client.
